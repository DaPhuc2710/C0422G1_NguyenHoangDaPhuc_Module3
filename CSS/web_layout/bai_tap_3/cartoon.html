        <p>Tớ là Mari </p>
        <p>You might be asking, “Brandon, you are a big bestselling author. Why are you writing a video game
            adaptation?” My answer is simple: I can do it because I’m a big bestselling author.</p>
        <p>
            Let me explain. I’ve reached a point, due in no small part to luck of the draw, that I’m capable of passing
            on any project I want and writing only the things that interest me. I have somewhat eclectic tastes. I’ve
            said over and over again that one of the ways I stay fresh when working on large projects is by doing things
            I haven’t done before. Last year, this itch was scratched by The Alloy of Law and Death by Pizza.</p>
        <p>I initially downplayed the Infinity Blade offer. However, after a little back-and-forth, I realized that this
            project had the potential to be a whole lot of fun. They gave me complete creative freedom, yet I also had
            some pretty strong constraints. They had built a video game (a very fun one, by the way) that was very
            popular. My challenge was to take things placed into the game because of mechanics, and actually build magic
            systems, a world, characters, and a story to match them. The game developers had some ideas, but they told
            me I could do anything at all that I wanted.</p>
        <p>I’ve often said that interesting limitations make for interesting magic systems in books. Well, I’ve also
            found that interesting limitations in writing can force me to grow and stretch in different ways as a
            writer. I took on the project partially because the guys I was working with were so much fun, but also
            because, as a gamer, I’ve always had a bit of an itch to be involved in video games in one way or another.
            (I’ve always envied Orson Scott Card, for example, who worked on the original Monkey Island, one of the
            great games of all time.)</p>
